## Project Structure


- **Backend**: Contains the PHP codebase responsible for handling the server-side logic, including API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication. The backend is built using PHP and can be set up to run on a server or locally using tools like Docker.
  
- **Frontend**: Contains the Vue.js codebase responsible for the user interface, where users can input and track their expenses. The frontend is built using modern JavaScript technologies and is designed to provide a seamless user experience.
